D3 demonstration/tutorail for Pearl Hacks @ UNC

This demonstration uses d3's force directed layout. I've included two data sets that you may use. I'm going to demonstrate using the kevinBacon.json file. This is a .json file that I compiled myself for a force directed visualization that I created this past summer. It includes a list of movies that were filmed in Georgia recently and how they relate to certain actors.
This data set it smaller than the miserables.json file.

I've also included the original demonstration data, miserables.json. Feel free to use this as well, it just shows a much more condensed version of the visualization.
